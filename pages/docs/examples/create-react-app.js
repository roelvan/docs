[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) is a boilerplate tool used to create Single Page Applications with React.js without build configuration. Facebook created CRA and made it the official way to start a new React application.

In this page we're going to focus on how to deploy a Single Page Application made with Create React App to ${<Now color="#000"/>}. If you want to learn how to use this boilerplate tool we recommend you to read their [repository's README](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md).

## Setup

Now static deployments made use of [serve-handler](https://github.com/zeit/serve-handler) in their core. This let us define custom configuration for our static deployment. In our case, since we are going to deploy a Single Page Application we need to define every non-found path to return our \`index.html\` in order to let our SPA use a router without hashbangs.

${
  <Code>{`{
  "type": "static",
  "files": [
    "./build"
  ],
  "static": {
    "public": "/build",
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}</Code>
}

The \`type\` key define the type of deployment. In this case due the existence of a \`package.json\` Now will consider it a Node.js deployment, with this it can be forced to be a \`static\` one.

The \`files\` key define which files Now should upload to the deployment, in this case only the \`./build\` directory will be uploaded.

The \`public\` key tells Now to only serve the \`/build\` directory as if it was the root.

The \`rewrites\` key tells Now to reply with \`/index.html\` for any possible path if it didn't found a matching file. This is what enables your static deployment to work as a Single Page Application.

## Deploying the application

Once we did that we can deploy our application with the following command:

${<TerminalInput>npm run build && now</TerminalInput>}

Once the application is built and ${<Now color="#000" />} has finished uploading the files, you'll see a URL that points to your freshly created Single Page Application.

But in the case of a real application (not used for testing purposes), you would now have to ${<InternalLink href="/docs/features/aliases">assign an alias</InternalLink>} to it.
